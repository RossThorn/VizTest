Escort Services,"Escort Services is a broad term used widely in the commercial sex trade, referring to commercial sex acts that primarily occur at a temporary indoor location. The operations are often described as “out-call,” where traffickers deliver victims to a buyer’s hotel room or residence for “private parties,” or as “in-call,” where potential buyers cycle in and out of a hotel room where the trafficker has confined the victim for extended stays. These cyclical business operations repeat once the trafficker relocates the survivor to another city where the demand for commercial sex is booming. Over the years, there have been fluctuations in popular online advertising platforms for commercial sex, but the most prevalent online marketplace is Backpage.com. Though Backpage closed its U.S. Adult Services section in January 2017 due to rising pressure from the U.S. Senate, Backpage has accounted for more than 1,300 cases of trafficking within escort services and remains a driving force in global sexual exploitation.","Trafficker profiles range from a single trafficker exploiting their victim (often their intimate partner) to coordinated networks of traffickers affiliated with organized crime. All traffickers employ force, fraud, and coercion.","Victims may be tricked into a situation through fraudulent job offers, such as fake modeling contracts. Traffickers may also recruit victims by pretending to have a romantic interest in the victim or falsely promising that they can provide shelter, financial support, or other benefits.","The vast majority of the survivors of “escort services” are U.S. citizen women and girls, although men and boys also make up a small percentage. LGBTQ youth are also vulnerable, as shown by the Urban Institute’s 2015 report. “Surviving the Streets of New York”1, in which homeless LGBTQ youth reported trading sex through online ads and social media, at hotels, and at customers’ residences.","Extreme physical and sexual violence, often accompanied by weapons, is common, as is coercion in the form of unmanageable quotas, debts, threats of harm or police involvement, excessive monitoring, gang intimidation, social isolation, and constant surveillance. Traffickers often condition victims to believe they are the only ones who care for them, manipulating an attachment bond that makes the decision to leave the trafficker extremely difficult.","Victims may be tricked into a situation through fraudulent job offers, such as fake modeling contracts.",4651,Null,Null,225,5%,4355,94%,34,<1%,2762,59%,1986,43%,2120,46%,445,10%
"Illicit Massage, Health, & Beauty","Illicit massage, health, and beauty businesses present a façade of legitimate spa services, concealing that their primary business is the sex and labor trafficking of women trapped in these businesses. Although they appear to be single storefronts, the majority are controlled as part of larger networks – with one to three people owning several businesses at a time. Research suggests there are at least 7,000 storefronts in the U.S., and possibly far more.","On-site managers tend to be women of the same ethnicity and may have been trafficked themselves in these businesses before becoming part of the larger trafficking network. The similarity in age and ethnicity of managers and women who are managers-in-training can make it difficult to distinguish potential victims from potential controllers at a glance. This can add to the level of control and coercion that traffickers have over their victims. Preliminary research suggests that business owners may have a variety of racial and ethnic profiles; as noted, business owners often own several illicit massage businesses as part of a larger network.",These networks are connected to larger operators that assist with recruitment of women in their home country or women who are searching for work in the United States as immigrants with limited English.,"Most victims of illicit massage businesses are women from the mid-thirties to late fifties from China and South Korea. In other illicit health and beauty businesses, labor trafficking survivors are typically younger females (mid-twenties and older) from Southeast Asia.","Survivors are controlled through coercion, including extreme intimidation, threats of shame, isolation from the outside community, debt bondage, exploitation of communication barriers, and explicit as well as implied threats. Women are typically forced to live at the business or in another location with their movement controlled between work and home.

Outdoor Solicitation,"Outdoor solicitation occurs when traffickers force victims to find buyers in an outdoor, public setting. In many cities, this occurs on a particular block or at cross streets known for commercial sex and often referred to as a “track” or “stroll.” In more rural areas, outdoor solicitation frequently takes place at truck or rest stops along major highways.","These individuals tend to operate more independently rather than in networks with other traffickers, although some domestic gang influences have been documented.",Traffickers frequently recruit victims by posing as a romantic partner or exploiting an existing intimate relationship. Traffickers often recognize specific vulnerabilities and modify their recruitment efforts to exploit those factors by initially offering economic and emotional support.,"According to Polaris-operated hotline data, survivors are overwhelmingly U.S. citizen women and girls. Additionally, 48 percent of LGBTQ youth surveyed in “Surviving the Streets of New York” reported finding customers for commercial sex on the street2. Women and girls of color are also disproportionately represented in the data. While victims represent diverse experiences and socioeconomic backgrounds, a review of the data found that certain inequalities and societal factors may make particular individuals especially vulnerable. These factors include histories of trauma and abuse, addiction, chronic mental health issues, and economic hardship such as homelessness or unstable housing. Runaway and homeless youth are particularly vulnerable.","Hotline data has shown that traffickers more frequently use physical violence in outdoor solicitation than in other types of sex trafficking, but also exploit their intimate relationship, isolating them from support networks, and inducing or exploiting substance abuse issues. Verbal abuse and other types of manipulation are also common. Traffickers often confiscate a victim’s entire earnings, set unrealistic nightly quotas, and deny food and shelter as punishment if the quota is not met.",Traffickers more frequently use physical violence in outdoor solicitation than in other types of sex trafficking.,1643,Null,Null,64,4%,1548,94%,12,<1%,834,50%,844,50%,691,42%,55,3%
Residential,"Sex trafficking can occur within organized residential brothels run by a network of coordinated traffickers or within private households used more informally for commercial sex. Residential brothels that follow the first, more formalized model tend to cater to commercial sex buyers from similar ethnic and/or language backgrounds, advertising through word of mouth or covert business cards. Advertisement for the second model varies but often includes word of mouth, and Backpage.com is emerging as a frequent source.","In the first model, traffickers may be part of larger, organized networks, and in some cases may have formal or informal ties to organized crime groups such as gangs or cartels. In the second model, residential brothels may be private homes where inter-familial or intimate partner trafficking is taking place.","The first model tends to involve victims recruited through fake romantic interests, false job offers, or fraudulent immigration promises. In the second model, hotline data indicates that family members and intimate partners usually begin exploiting victims within homes opportunistically due to extreme economic hardship.","In more formalized brothels, victims tend to be women and to a lesser extent girls, with many victims from Latin America, particularly Mexico, and from Southeast Asia, particularly China. Sex trafficking within residences informally used as brothels typically involves child victims, with boys making up a growing percentage.","In the first model, networked traffickers often employ physical violence, lethal threats to victims and their families, debt bondage, and extreme confinement and monitoring. As noted, the second model tends to involve a higher percentage of minor victims than other types of sex trafficking. Although force, fraud, and coercion may not be necessary, common methods can include confinement, inducing illicit substances, threats to harm or expose, and exploiting the familial or intimate relationship.","Sex trafficking within residences informally used as brothels typically involves child victims, with boys making up a growing percentage.",1290,Null,Null,99,8%,1219,94%,7,<1%,820,64%,617,48%,432,33%,304,24%
Domestic Work,"Domestic or homecare workers often live within their employers’ households and provide services such as cooking, cleaning, and caretaking for children and the elderly or infirm. Labor trafficking for domestic work may also occur within the cycle of intimate partner violence or forced marriage situations as a means of maintaining or exerting power and control.","Traffickers in this type have diverse profiles. Many are wealthy individuals, sometimes from the victim’s home country. Domestic workers with A-3 and G-5 visas are especially vulnerable to the imbalanced power dynamic inherent in temporary work visas due to the trafficker’s elevated status as a diplomat, royal, or high-ranking member of an influential international organization. This status makes the fear of speaking out even greater and can allow traffickers to continue exploiting victims under the protection of diplomatic immunity. Family members and intimate partners may also be traffickers, though less commonly.","In cases reported to Polaris-operated hotlines, most survivors enter their situation on a B-1, A-3, or G-5 temporary work visa. Fraud with J-1 Au Pair visas and, increasingly, with B-2 (tourist) visas also occurs. Additionally, U.S. citizens and foreign national women on K-1 (fiancé) visas may experience labor trafficking for domestic work.","Hotline data reflects that survivors are predominantly middle-aged to older-aged women from the Philippines, while many are U.S. citizens or survivors from Latin America, India, and numerous countries spanning Sub-Saharan Africa. Survivors in this data came from more than 105 countries. Male victims were reported in 12 percent of the cases and child victims in 8 percent.","Labor trafficking victims in domestic work commonly work 12-18 hours a day (some as much as 24/7) for little to no pay. They may experience extreme isolation and confinement from the outside world, sexual harassment, high levels of monitoring, debt bondage, extreme wage theft, confiscation of critical documents such as passports, and restricted access to food and medical care. Traffickers often intentionally allow the victim’s visa to expire and use the newly undocumented status to create fear and distrust, which leads to even greater submission. Because of this, labor trafficking of domestic workers can often last for years or even decades.",Labor trafficking victims in domestic work commonly work 12-18 hours a day (some as much as 24/7) for little to no pay.,1586,1190,396,139,12%,1043,88%,4,<1%,1039,87%,97,8%,106,9%,1004,84%
"Bars, Strip Clubs, & Cantinas","Human trafficking in this type fronts as legitimate bars, restaurants, or clubs selling food and alcohol while exploiting victims for both sex and labor behind the scenes. Victims are forced to provide customers of the cantina with flirtatious companionship to entice them to purchase high-priced alcoholic beverages that often come with an explicit or implicit agreement for commercial sex acts as well. Polaris has identified several distinct business models within this industry. These include bars and cantinas that are entirely run by organized human trafficking networks. However, at other locations traffickers have agreements with the business owners that allow them to operate prostitution rings out of the bar or cantina in exchange for a portion of the criminal profits. In addition to the cantina-like businesses, many strip clubs and go-go clubs are associated with this type of sex and labor trafficking.","In some of the cantinas, organized human trafficking networks run the operations. Male and female traffickers based in Mexico or Central America operate or cooperate with criminal networks to sustain complicated, multiyear supply lines of new victims and to ensure that victims comply. U.S. citizens may also be traffickers in this network. In some cases, traffickers directly cooperate with, or are members of, cartels or U.S.-based street gangs. Traffickers may also be intimate partners or family members of their victims. Owners of the cantinas or bars may be directly involved in the trafficking and exploitation, or they may not be aware of this activity. Traffickers who use strip clubs are typically less networked than the cantina-like businesses and can often be intimate partners of the victims. Some links with Eastern European organized crime have emerged and merit more research.","Victims are deceived and enticed with promises of better job opportunities, romantic relationships, and safe migration to the U.S.","Bars and cantinas frequently victimize women and girls from Mexico and Central America aged 14 to 29, and the clientele is normally limited to men from local Latino communities. Most trafficking in go-go clubs and strip clubs involves U.S. citizen women and girls, as well as some from Eastern Europe. Male victims have also been reported.","A significant degree of violence is often reported in these cases, with women and girls severely beaten into submission, sexually assaulted, and threatened with weapons and death to their families if they do not comply. They frequently are trapped due to insurmountable debts to their traffickers. In addition, victims can be exploited for labor when they are forced to waitress, sometimes for excessive hours with no breaks or pay.","Thousands of women and girls from Mexico, Central America, and U.S. Latino communities are prisoners of a violent underground sex economy in the United States.

Pornography,"The National Hotline has documented cases of family members, intimate partners, and individual sex traffickers earning profit from distributing a victim’s non-consenting appearance in pornographic material. The related issue of “revenge porn” is also a concern within relationship violence and can be considered high risk for sex trafficking. For cases involving webcams, please refer to Remote Interactive Sexual Acts. This type also includes the production and distribution of child pornography. The National Hotline frequently receives tips via our online reporting tool linking to suspicious websites that may contain child pornography. While the hotline records data from these reports, the hotline is unable to investigate such links to verify the legitimacy and therefore forwards all potential child pornography tips to The National Center of Missing and Exploited Children. Please visit the center for more information.","Due to limited data, little is known about typical trafficker profiles, except that in many cases traffickers may be intimate partners or family members of their victims. Traffickers within formal pornography production companies have also been recorded in Polaris-operated hotline cases, but data is thin.","Due to limited data, little is known, except that traffickers may exploit existing romantic or familial relationships.","While some tips of sex trafficking in pornography supply limited data due to the caller’s distance from the situation, in hotline cases where enough information was provided to establish high indicators of sex trafficking, data has revealed that survivors tend to be U.S. citizens. While most survivors in these cases are female, the rate of male victimization is four times the rate in other sex trafficking types.","An existing intimate partner may use manipulation, “gaslighting,” threats of harm, and substance abuse to coerce or defraud adult victims into pornography and subsequently sell the explicit content to websites or individual buyers. In some cases, traffickers may force a victim to engage in commercial sex, film the sex act, and then sell or threaten to sell the content.

Traveling Sales Crew,"Traveling sales crews move between cities and states and go door-to-door, often selling fraudulent products such as magazine subscriptions that customers may never receive. Young salespeople are rarely fully compensated, they sell from morning until night, and are unable to leave due to fraud, manipulation, and coercion. As a result, sales crews find this business model of labor trafficking financially rewarding and low-risk. Data shows numerous linkages between sales crews and a larger national business network. It can be challenging to find these links because many organizations, particularly those with a long record of fraud-related complaints, frequently change their names and operating locations while remaining under the same ownership.","Traffickers may be crew managers or business owners. These crews and businesses are highly networked, with numerous connections among different business owners.","Recruitment occurs through social media, online classifieds, posters at schools, and person-to-person contact (most common). Fraud is rampant in the hiring process, and crew members routinely note that working conditions and sales commissions are significantly misrepresented in advertisements or during recruitment.","Traffickers in traveling sales crews will specifically target teens and young adults from marginalized and economically disadvantaged communities. Although most crews claim to hire those who are at least 18, minors as young as 15 can be involved. Unlike other types of labor trafficking, the victims in this category are overwhelmingly U.S. citizens.","Managers control nearly all aspects of the lives of crew members and drivers while they are on the road, and isolate them from wider society by imposing long work hours, moving frequently between regions, employing intense peer pressure and public shaming of workers, and controlling after-hours activity. Managers may deny crew members food, confiscate their driver’s licenses, or threaten them if they do not meet their daily sales quotas. Victims are typically paid a stipend of $5 to $20, the rest allegedly covering “debts” for lodging and transportation. Victims who wish to leave the crew are often abandoned in remote and unfamiliar areas, with no belongings or means of returning home as an “example” to other crew members to keep them from complaining or seeking help. In nearly a quarter of cases reported to the Polaris-operated hotlines, callers indicated that managers or fellow crew members physically assaulted salespeople who wished to leave. Sexual assault was reported in numerous cases.","The victims in Traveling Sales Crews are overwhelmingly U.S. citizens.

Restuarants & Food Service,"Labor trafficking within the restaurant and food industry has been documented in nearly all kinds of food service and may involve bars, clubs, buffets, taquerias, or food and ice cream trucks. People working as cooks, bus staff, and wait staff may be exploited, with traffickers often taking advantage of language barriers between exploited workers and patrons—and in some cases other workers at the same restaurant who are not being abused—to help avoid detection.","With this type it can be difficult for even survivors to decipher who their primary trafficker is since the links between the smugglers, recruiters, and restaurant management are sometimes unclear and may be deliberately obfuscated by the trafficker to help avoid detection. Information suggests that in some cases a single actor is primarily responsible, while in other cases multiple actors with different roles may be working in collaboration to exploit the workers.","In many cases, victims are recruited using false promises and charged extremely high fees by smugglers to ensure safety while migrating to the U.S. and a better-paying job, only to end up trapped in a restaurant and trafficked for their labor.","Data has indicated that foreign national men and women from East and Southeast Asia, Mexico, and Central America tend to be equally victimized. However, victims from almost every region of the world have been trafficked in the U.S. While a significant majority of victims are adults, nearly 20 percent of cases of potential labor trafficking in restaurants reported to the Polaris-hotlines involved minors. Of the individual victims identified in hotline cases, nearly a third were undocumented immigrants. Hotline data also shows many cases of labor trafficking in restaurants involving the same primary victim populations, but on J-1 and H-2B work visas.","Victims can be confined at the restaurant around the clock or be isolated in a nearby home provided by the traffickers. Situations become more exploitative when the employer controls employee housing where victims are charged well-above-market rates for crowded, substandard living conditions, food, and transportation, which can increase their debt and further prevent them from leaving. Victims who do attempt to leave or report abuse may face lethal threats to their families back home or be threatened with deportation. Victims on H-2B and J-1 visas face similar immigration and “blacklisting” threats due to the lack of visa portability and are subjected to poor housing conditions, wage theft, excessive hours, and discrimination.",Victims can be confined at the restaurant around the clock or be isolated in a nearby home provided by the traffickers.,1741,524,1217,286,55%,311,59%,<3,<1%,417,80%,95,18%,35,6%,433,83%
Peddling & Begging,"Forced peddling and begging is a well-known type of labor trafficking globally, but Polarisoperated hotlines tend to receive fewer direct reports from victims of this type in the U.S. due to a limited number of victims willing to speak out. One peddling scheme revealed by hotline data involves traffickers who pose under the guise of a seemingly legitimate charitable or religious organization claiming to provide trips and enrichment services to “at-risk youth.” In fact, these rings exploit young U.S. children by forcing them to sell candy or baked goods, or solicit “donations” on streets or in shopping centers.","Due to limited data, little is known. Some case data has shown familial links with traffickers forcing their more vulnerable family members into begging.","Due to limited data, little is known.","These victim demographics lead to the potential for increased vulnerabilities and populations ranging from foreign national men, women, and children with an unstable immigration status (such as an undocumented immigrant whose trafficker is the temporary U.S. sponsor) to foreign and U.S. citizens who have physical or intellectual disabilities and/or behavioral health concerns.","Although data is limited around elements of force, fraud, and coercion, information suggests that traffickers monitor and intimidate victims from a distance, compel excessive working hours, take most of the earnings, instill daily quotas, and deny victims access to education, food, or transportation.",Some case data has shown familial links with traffickers forcing their more vulnerable family members into begging.,553,494,59,279,56%,243,49%,0,0%,159,32%,364,74%,190,38%,78,16%
Agriculture & Animal Husbandry,"Traffickers exploit workers in the agriculture and animal husbandry industry, from corn fields to orange orchards to dairy farms. Some crops such as tobacco require much more intensive labor to harvest, making them more susceptible to forced labor or exploitation. Tobacco is the crop cited most often on Polaris-operated hotlines, accounting for 10 percent of all agricultural labor trafficking cases. Others frequently mentioned are cattle/dairy, oranges, tomatoes, and strawberries. Often an agricultural contract will promise an hourly rate but then pay on a piece-rate basis, which severely limits earning potential and further entraps the victims. Abuse and exploitation of agricultural workers can happen at multiple levels due to the complex labor supply chain of recruiters, managers, contractors, subcontractors, growers, and buyers.","Workers can find it difficult to determine exactly who is responsible for the origin of the exploitation, due to this complex supply chain. In some cases, there may be a single or main trafficker who has one of these roles, while in other cases exploitation may involve multiple actors.","Recruitment usually features a more formal approach than in other industries, with recruiters charging victims recruitment and travel fees that create insurmountable debt, even though these costs are the responsibility of the employer under U.S. visa regulations6 for H-2A holders. Less is known about recruitment of undocumented workers or holders of other visa types, though anecdotal hotline cases suggest that recruiters and recruitment fees may be present in some cases.","According to cases reported to Polaris-operated hotlines, survivors of this type of labor trafficking are disproportionately Latino male migrant workers, mostly from Mexico and Central America, on seasonal H-2A visas. South African men on H-2A visas rank a distant second. Latinas and unaccompanied foreign minors are also victimized. However, this data appears to differ from the findings of farmworker advocacy groups, which have reported serving mostly workers on other visa types and undocumented victims.","If a victim leaves an abusive work situation, they may lose their status, and some traffickers exploit this lack of visa portability to instill fears about deportation or immigration status. Traffickers in agriculture also isolate victims in rural parts of the country with little to no means of accessing community support. Despite the H-2A program requirement that employers supply workers with suitable housing, traffickers have also been known to subject victims to squalid living conditions, often denying them even basic necessities such as beds and indoor toilets. Victims are also frequently denied the protective gear to do their jobs safely. This is most evident in tobacco fields, where despite the risk of contracting green tobacco sickness (GTS), tobacco workers on Polaris-operated hotlines frequently reported that their employers did not provide them with equipment that is necessary when directly handling tobacco leaves and pesticides. Oftentimes medical care is deliberately delayed or not offered for even the most severe workplace injuries or illnesses. By far the most common method of control in agriculture, as in many other types, is economic abuse, including wage theft, improper deductions, and payment at piece rates rather than hourly rates.","Traffickers have been known to subject victims to squalid living conditions, often denying them even basic necessities such as beds and indoor toilets.",1953,424,1529,365,86%,72,17%,0,0%,376,89%,35,8%,16,4%,387,91%
Personal Sexual Servitude,"With cases of personal sexual servitude, the lines between trafficker, recruiter, and buyer are blurred and largely depend on how the victim views each perpetrator. Personal sexual servitude takes various forms, and the payment is not always cash. In addition, the line between ongoing sexual abuse and personal sexual servitude is complex, and different survivors may define their experiences differently. Personal sexual servitude can occur when a woman or girl is permanently sold, often by her family to settle a drug debt, to an individual buyer for the explicit purpose of engaging in periodic sex acts over a long period of time. It can also occur within a commercial non-consenting marriage situation, primarily involving adult foreign national women and their families or U.S. spouses. In some of these forced marriages, the survivors can possess K-1 (fiancé) visas. Some victims are forced to do domestic work. Runaway homeless youth and LGBTQ minors without a third-party facilitator may also be victims of personal sexual servitude when they are coerced to engage in sex on an ongoing basis in order to receive basic needs such as shelter, food, and medications.","Trafficker profiles vary widely and may include members of organized crime syndicates, smugglers, intimate partners, family members, and landlords.","As noted, this form is heterogeneous, and recruitment varies. In some cases, victims may be “sold” by a family member to a trafficker. In other cases, recruitment involves the exploiter posing as a benefactor for the victim or misrepresenting the living arrangement or relationship. Additional cases include exploitation by intimate partners.","Victim profiles vary significantly. In most cases reported to Polaris-operated hotlines, victims are U.S. citizens. Runaway homeless youth and LGBTQ minors are particularly vulnerable. Adults facing economic hardship and unstable housing are also at risk. Foreign national victims are predominantly women and girls from Mexico and Central America, though victims from Southeast Asia have also been reported.","Exploiters use ongoing sexual assaults, physical abuse, confinement and isolation, threats, substance abuse, and/or withholding food, shelter, or drugs as forms of abuse or punishment.","In some cases, victims may be “sold” by a family member to a trafficker.

Heath & Beauty Services,"Labor trafficking and exploitation has been known to occur in businesses such as nail salons, hair salons, and health spas. Though workers interact regularly with customers, providing services such as manicures and facials, due to language barriers and intensive monitoring, it can be difficult for workers to reach out for help.","Due to limited data, little is known, but traffickers predominantly have an employer relationship with victims, and many are from Vietnam or China. In a smaller subset of cases, the trafficker was a victim’s intimate partner or spouse.","Little is known due to limited data, though preliminary information from hotline cases suggests that recruitment can involve high levels of fraud and deceit such as misrepresenting wages, working conditions, and immigration and educational benefits. This recruitment fraud is also a form of control.","Hotline data indicates that most survivors are from Vietnam or China, with a smaller portion possibly being naturalized U.S. citizens. It’s worth noting, however, that many of these hotline cases are reported by community members who may not have direct knowledge of victim or trafficker demographics. For example, external research has shown a substantial subset of South Korean workers within the industry, and they are not prominently reflected in hotline data. Polaris data indicates that most victims are adult women, while men are victims in nearly 25 percent of cases. Minor victims have been referenced in fewer than five percent of cases.","Victims are often not aware of the possible “intern” periods, when they work extensive hours for no wage and are lucky if they get to keep tips in cash. Exposure to harsh chemicals without proper masks and gloves is another concern, as is frequent movement between salons to further hinder victims from establishing support or accessing help. Victims never remain in the same city for a stable period of time, and they are heavily monitored and tend to live isolated within the business or rely solely on traffickers for transportation, making it almost impossible to escape control. Additionally, many victims remain in their abusive situation hoping for promised immigration and educational benefits that never materialize.","They are heavily monitored and tend to live isolated within the business or rely solely on traffickers for transportation, making it almost impossible to escape control.",411,295,116,70,24%,268,91%,0,0%,244,83%,36,12%,9,3%,232,79%
Construction,"Victims of labor trafficking may be forced to work in the construction industry, usually within small contracting businesses completing tasks such as roofing, carpentry, welding, electrical work, and masonry on both large commercial construction sites as well as in private homes. Employers may misclassify workers as independent contractors, thus limiting their access to worker protections and benefits.","Because of the complicated nature of the labor supply chain and the roles of direct employers, recruiters, contractors, and smugglers, in many cases victims are unable to identify who is responsible for their exploitation. Some traffickers deliberately obfuscate the labor supply chain to avoid detection.","Workers can enter their exploitative situations through formal job offers and misrepresented visa contracts. In some cases, workers may be charged illegal and exorbitant recruitment fees, which may be a method of control to keep workers in abusive situations. Recruitment may also begin through an abusive migration journey or through word-of-mouth referrals.","The majority of labor trafficking survivors in construction are men from Mexico and the Northern Triangle (El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala), most of whom have H-2B visas or are undocumented. U.S. citizen survivors have also been forced to perform construction jobs under the control of fraudulent religious organizations, unscrupulous residential and drug recovery programs, and individuals posing as landlords exploiting a victim’s homelessness.","Victim wages are drastically deducted, and many experience withholding of all payment as a means of control by their traffickers. Hotline data also shows that victims are kept in their trafficking situation through threats of deportation and threats to blacklist the worker from future U.S. jobs if he leaves or reports his situation. Survivors have also reported experiencing verbal abuse, harassment, and denial of necessities such as water and safety equipment.","Employers may misclassify workers as independent contractors, thus limiting their access to worker protections and benefits.",549,144,405,124,86%,20,14%,0,0%,123,85%,25,17%,21,15%,120,83%
Hotels & Hospitality,"Victims of labor trafficking have been found in hospitality businesses such as hotels, motels, resorts, or casinos working as front desk attendants, bell staff, and, most frequently, in housekeeping.","Traffickers may be in hotel management or with a labor recruiter/labor broker that subcontracts with the hotel to provide labor. If the trafficker is a contractor, the hotel may not be aware of the abuse.","Most commonly, workers were recruited with job offers that misrepresented the working conditions, wages, and the ability to safely leave the job. In other cases, workers were recruited via other fraudulent promises.","Most are women and men from Jamaica, the Philippines, and India, and typically they are told that they will make lucrative wages to support family back home. Most victims enter the job with an H-2B visa, which restricts visa portability, tying victims to their abusive employer. J-1 visas are also used, though less frequently. U.S. citizen victims have also been reported to the hotline. Adults made up the vast majority of victims reported to Polaris-operated hotlines.","Debt bondage and other forms of economic abuse, such as withholding or confiscating payment, were the most common types of control reported in hotline cases. Other problems included confinement to the hotel property and constant monitoring, altered or fake contracts, physical abuse, and sexual harassment.

Landscaping,"Victims of labor trafficking in landscaping are responsible for maintaining public or private grounds, gardens, and nurseries. Landscaping is the most commonly referenced type of labor trafficking and exploitation involving H-2B visa holders in cases reported to Polaris-operated hotlines. H-2B visa holders are not eligible for federally funded legal services, making it extremely difficult to secure services for victims in landscaping.","Supervisors and owners of landscaping companies and subcontractors are often the exploiters, though due to limited hotline data, little is known about trafficker demographics.","Most victims were recruited through job offers that turned out to be fraudulent or through other false promises or misrepresented work contracts. Some recruiters may also be responsible for the abuse and trafficking, though in cases reported to Polaris-operated hotlines, this was significantly less common than fraud by employers.","Sixty-three percent of hotline cases involved men from Mexico. Some of the workers were from Guatemala or were U.S. citizens. Cases involving women and children are rare, according to Polaris-operated hotlines.","Exploitation in landscaping sheds light on what is most problematic about the H-2B system, which allows employers and recruiters to exploit victims with little regard for standard worker protection laws. Workers may be forced to pay rent to their employers at rates much higher than market, despite sometimes not getting paid for their work. Threats to blacklist victims to prevent them from attaining employment in the U.S. in the future are not uncommon due to the lack of visa portability. Additionally, in many cases reported to the hotlines, victims’ wages were confiscated or withheld to keep them from leaving. Victims also experienced various threats to themselves and/or their families if they sought help.","Workers may be forced to pay rent to their employers at rates much higher than market, despite sometimes not getting paid for their work.",776,112,664,103,92%,12,11%,0,0%,101,90%,12,11%,5,4%,103,92%
Illicit Activities,"Criminal syndicates in illegal industries can exploit people for profit with the same levels of force, fraud, and coercion as in any legitimate labor industry. Polaris has seen this type of trafficking most frequently with street-level drug distribution businesses and cross-border drug smuggling, along with general domestic gang activity. Based on hotline data, traffickers have also exploited victims in the hazardous business of illicit drug production and in the isolated marijuana cultivation industry in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest, though limited data is available. Labor trafficking within illicit activities can occur in tandem with sex trafficking business models, as evidenced by the additional 76 cases reported to Polaris-operated hotlines that involved both sex trafficking and labor trafficking for illicit activity. The accompanying sex trafficking usually occurs when a drug distributer not only forces an intimate partner to sell drugs but to trade sex in exchange for a supply. These activities often intersect with a sub-type of residential sex trafficking that occurs in private residences used informally as commercial drug distribution homes.","According to hotline data, traffickers in this type include victims’ intimate partners, fellow members of domestic street gangs, independent drug dealers and producers, and highly coordinated Latino cartels.",Drug distributors often recruit their intimate partners to sell drugs. Domestic gangs tend to target vulnerable boys and young men who are looking for protection and a surrogate “family unit” and convince them to act as lookouts and commit burglary and sometimes more violent crimes for profit. Latino cartels and other criminal entities are known to abduct people or fraudulently promise their victims protection in their migration to the United States only to force them to carry drugs across the border.,"Adult and minor female intimate partners of drug dealers, both U.S. citizen and foreign national, are routinely forced to sell drugs. In addition, domestic gangs target young U.S. citizen boys. Finally, men and vulnerable, unaccompanied boys from Mexico and Central America are chronically trafficked in cartel-controlled drug smuggling schemes.","Traffickers use extreme threats of violence against the victim and family members, intimidation in the form of gang/cartel connections, manipulation, and intense monitoring to coerce and control victims. Physical violence, often involving weapons, is also very likely in drug distribution and smuggling.",Latino cartels and other criminal entities are known to abduct people or fraudulently promise their victims protection in their migration to the United States only to force them to carry drugs across the border.,187,111,76,68,61%,47,42%,<3,<1%,82,74%,30,27%,24,22%,62,56%
Arts & Entertainment,"Cases of labor trafficking have been reported to Polaris-operated hotlines in a variety of sectors of the arts and entertainment industry, including modeling, athletics and, less commonly, in performing arts such as acting, choirs, and dance troupes. The hotlines also have received reports of labor trafficking in exotic dancing. While the lines between sex and labor trafficking in strip clubs is often complex, if the adult victim is forced into exotic dancing with no accompanying sex act, this would be classified as labor trafficking.","Traffickers include recruiters and executives in model management companies ranging from small independent agencies to large corporate entities, as well as individual “coaches” in athletics. Strip club and exotic dancing club owners are often culpable actors in trafficking, though a significant number of cases reported to the hotlines involve a victim being trafficked in a strip club by an intimate partner not affiliated with the club.","In the modeling industry, foreign and U.S. citizen women can be fraudulently recruited through social media and online classifieds with exaggerated job offers and fake immigration benefits. Young boys in athletics are recruited through an individual “coach” who convinces their families to pay outlandish recruitment fees with promises of a flourishing sports career and better educational opportunities. Recruitment in strip clubs can begin with a legitimate job offer or fake romantic pursuits.","Young women (both U.S. and foreign nationals) are often victimized in the modeling industry. Although more data is needed on typical visas used by traffickers, fraud involving H-1B and B-2 tourist visas have been documented. Labor trafficking in athletics often involves boys and young men from Latin America and West Africa, and U.S. citizen women are the majority trafficked for labor in strip clubs.","Victims in the modeling industry may be sexually abused and harassed, not paid, or charged exorbitant fees for crowded housing. When victims involved in athletics arrive in the U.S., they are enrolled in competitive school teams or traveling leagues and sometimes forced to practice and exercise from morning to night, causing exhaustion. Food and hygiene are limited, and victims never see any of the prize money from competitions. The most common types of control used to coerce victims in strip clubs are economic abuse (primarily wage confiscation and sometimes high fees) and emotional abuse and psychological manipulation, which can be particularly coercive when the trafficker is an intimate partner of the victim.","Young boys in athletics are recruited through an individual “coach” who convinces their families to pay outlandish recruitment fees. In the modeling industry, foreign and U.S. citizen women can be fraudulently recruited through social media and online classifieds with exaggerated job offers and fake immigration benefits.",154,102,52,25,25%,81,79%,0,0%,84,82%,21,21%,38,37%,39,38%
Commercial Cleaning Services,"The National Hotline has encountered trafficking and labor exploitation within commercial cleaning businesses that provide janitorial and housekeeping services to multiple private households, office buildings, and other commercial businesses.","Trafficker networks are largely unknown, but some data has shown traffickers can be either business owners or family members of survivors.","Fraudulent job offers or other false promises are the most common methods of recruitment, according to limited hotline data. Family pressure and manipulation can also be present.","Though limited data is available, there is sufficient evidence that foreign national men, women, and unaccompanied children from Latin America are most susceptible to labor trafficking within these businesses. Others are from the Philippines and the Caribbean or are U.S. citizens.","Common methods of exploitation include withholding or confiscating wages, verbal abuse, exhausting hours, and exposure to hazardous cleaning chemicals without proper protective equipment. The situation may become trafficking when victims are told they must work off a debt, their passports are withheld, or they’re coerced with threats of homelessness or deportation if they refuse to continue working.","Foreign national men, women, and unaccompanied children from Latin America are most susceptible to labor trafficking within these businesses.",437,93,344,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases
Factories & Manufacturing,"Workers in food processing, clothing, and shoe manufacturing factories are especially vulnerable to labor abuse and trafficking. Polaris-operated hotlines have also documented labor trafficking and exploitation cases in a wide range of other manufacturing facilities, including factories producing electronic devices and vehicles.","More information on trafficker demographics is needed, but as with most labor trafficking types, direct supervisors and middle managers tend to facilitate abuse. The National Hotline has also documented family connections between traffickers and survivors.","While data is limited, preliminary hotline data suggests that fraudulent job offers are common. Some victims have reported being recruited by family members.","H-2B visa holders are often victims, but minors also have been referenced in National Hotline cases. Nationalities are much more diverse than in most other labor trafficking types, but the highest concentrations are from Southeast Asia, Latin America, and India.","Victims tend to be subjected to long hours, extreme surveillance, confiscation of documents, and threats of harm. Victims have reported being denied bathroom breaks to increase assembly line productivity and being locked inside the factory. In addition to being a form of coercion used to control victims, this confinement is a significant safety concern. According to hotline data, workers also frequently experience verbal abuse and degradation as a means of control, as well as economic abuse such as the withholding of wages or creation of debts to keep workers in abusive situations. Victims may also experience threats to blacklist them from future employment opportunities or to report them to immigration authorities.","Victims tend to be subjected to long hours, extreme surveillance, confiscation of documents, and threats of harm.

Remote Interactive Sexual Acts,"Remote interactive sexual acts are live commercial sex acts simulated through remote contact between the buyer and victim through technologies such as webcams, text-based chats, and phone sex lines. Because of the lack of physical contact between the victim and buyer, traffickers can frame this business during victim recruitment as a “low-risk” endeavor. However, as with all commercial sex, this business model becomes sex trafficking if the victims are compelled to participate under force, fraud, or coercion, or if the victim is under the age of 18.","Little is known about trafficker profiles and network structure for this type of sex trafficking, although limited hotline data suggests that a trafficker’s relationship to the victim can range from a significant other to someone a victim considers nothing more than an exploiter.","Recruitment tends to involve posing as a benefactor, promising lucrative earnings, professional modeling opportunities, or false romantic interests. Hotline data also include cases where webcam websites and phone lines are used as recruitment grounds for sex traffickers.","In the limited number of cases reported to Polarisoperated hotlines, U.S. citizen females are the most frequent victims; minors are victimized in just under half of all cases. The same data has also revealed a surprising 12 percent of cases involve the LGBTQ community, most commonly in regard to the identity of the victim(s). Causes for such a high incidence of LGBTQ victims merit more research because that rate is much higher than the common 2 to 5 percent of LGBTQ cases in other types of human trafficking.","In some cases victims have reported manipulation, threats of violence, isolation, and/or debt to traffickers or recruiters, though due to limited data, little is known about exact details.",U.S. citizen females are the most frequent victims; minors are victimized in just under half of all cases.,78,Null,Null,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases
Carnivals,"Labor exploitation and human trafficking cases involving carnival workers have been reported to the National Hotline. Workers are responsible for operating rides, games, and food stands, as well as for assembling and disassembling carnival equipment for movement between cities. Carnival companies may contract with state and county fairs to provide rides and games, and a small number of companies and recruiters dominate the U.S. carnival industry.",Formal labor recruiters and carnival owners and supervisors tend to be responsible for abuse and exploitation. Data indicates that these are typically U.S. citizen men.,"Formal H-2B labor agents dominate the recruitment, falsely promising safe and fair working conditions throughout the season. Instead, some victims have attested that they were made to pay illegal recruitment fees for the job, visa, and/or transportation and had to sleep in crowded, dilapidated trailers.","Most cases involve men and women from Mexico or South Africa on H-2B visas. While some U.S. citizens have been documented to work at carnivals, the extent of their potential exploitation is relatively unknown.","Victims have been known to stay awake around the clock to set up, operate, and dismantle equipment before traveling to the next city to repeat the exhausting process. This lack of sleep can cause serious workplace accidents due to extreme fatigue, for which victims are typically denied medical services. Isolation from any supportive services is also common due to the travel and lack of adequate legal protections for H-2B workers. Workers have also reported threats of blacklisting or deportation and document confiscation to keep them from leaving or reporting abuse. Workers may also experience wage theft, exorbitant fees for housing, and fraudulent payment deductions. Sometimes workers are told that their wages are being held for them until the end of their contracts, so if they try to leave abusive situations before then, they will have no money.","Sometimes workers are told that their wages are being held for them until the end of their contracts, so if they try to leave abusive situations before then, they will have no money.",131,52,79,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases
Forestry & Logging,"According to data from Polaris-operated hotlines, trafficking in the forestry industry has included pine tree farm workers, reforestation planters, loggers, and workers maintaining woodland areas.","Traffickers are typically management or crew leaders within the forestry business, although as in other complicated labor supply chains, victims sometimes have a difficult time understanding who is responsible for their exploitation.","Unfair recruitment practices are not uncommon and, as in other H-2B recruitment schemes, can include the victim being charged exorbitant and illegal fees.","Survivors in forestry are almost exclusively men from Mexico and Guatemala on H-2B visas, according to cases reported to the National Hotline.","Case data shows that victims are not paid by the hour as required by law, but are paid per acre or tree they plant, drastically decreasing earning potential. Traffickers may withhold or confiscate payment to keep workers from leaving. In some hotline cases, workers experienced debt bondage as another form of economic control. Document confiscation by traffickers is also frequently reported, along with threats to blacklist workers from future jobs or threats to have workers deported. Even though H2-B workers in forestry are entitled to government-funded legal services, victims are often kept in isolation and are unaware what city or state they are in, making it difficult or impossible to access help or report abuse. All the while, victims may suffer extreme physical violence, health complications from sleeping outdoors and hazardous work conditions, denial of medical care, and death threats to them or their families back home.","Victims may suffer extreme physical violence, health complications from sleeping outdoors and hazardous work conditions, denial of medical care, and death threats to them or their families back home.",213,50,163,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases
Health Care,"Labor trafficking victims in the healthcare industry are primarily found in nursing homes and as home health aides, according to hotline data. The lines between domestic work and in-home health care can be difficult to ascertain, since some domestic caregivers are expected to provide medical services without proper certification. Because of the intersections with home healthcare and domestic work, it is important to consider both industries when crafting intervention and disruption efforts.","With this type it can be difficult for even survivors to decipher who their primary trafficker is due to the complicated relationships among recruiters, staffing agencies, and employers. In some cases, the trafficker may obfuscate these relationships to avoid detection. The trafficker may even be part of the victim’s family.","The most frequent recruitment tactics are not known due to limited data, though preliminary hotline data suggests that misrepresented job offers and other false promises are used, and that in some cases the trafficker may use a family relationship with the victim as a recruitment strategy.","Migrant women from the Philippines are most prevalent in hotline data, followed by West African immigrant women and U.S. citizens. Victims may possess H-1B, H-2B, J-1, or H-1C (registered nurse) visas. Male survivors are involved in 23 percent of labor trafficking within the healthcare industry, according to Polaris-operated hotline cases.","As in domestic work, the overlapping methods of control include extreme isolation, monitoring, verbal degradation, threats of deportation or blacklisting, and document confiscation. High levels of fraud and misrepresentation of job conditions were also reported among victims on the hotlines. Economic abuse is the most frequent method of coercion and includes nonpayment or underpayment of wages, debt bondage, and limiting access to a victim’s own funds or bank accounts.","Migrant women from the Philippines are most prevalent in hotline data, followed by West African immigrant women and U.S. citizens.",105,46,59,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases
Recreational Facilities,"Labor trafficking for work in recreational facilities has been reported to the National Hotline in amusement parks, summer camps, golf courses, and community swimming pools, though it may also occur in other sectors of this industry. Positions at these facilities include lifeguards, camp counselors, ride attendants, and food vendors.","Limited data provides evidence that traffickers are typically part of the facility’s management. However, some cases have involved complicit visa sponsors and recruiters.","Victims are usually misled with false employment contracts promising free transportation to and from work, fairly priced housing, and a living wage.","While victims of labor exploitation tend to be young adults on J-1 visas as part of the work and travel program, nationalities run the gamut from countries across Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, East and Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and even the U.S. (about one-third of trafficking cases), according to hotline data.","Economic abuse, such as withholding wages, was the most common method used to control workers, along with intense monitoring and threats to deport or blacklist workers. Verbal abuse and document confiscation are also not uncommon methods used to keep workers in abusive situations. Although the J-1 is one of the only work visas that allows portability, the process for switching employers can be cumbersome and confusing for victims seeking to leave abusive employers.","Victims are usually misled with false employment contracts promising free transportation to and from work, fairly priced housing, and a living wage.",257,37,220,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases,Insufficient # of Cases
Types Yet To Be Defined,"Through data collected from Polaris-operated hotlines we have also documented 10 other types of human trafficking. These may become distinct types in the future as we accrue more data. Trafficking is occurring in legal brothels and in non-spa or bar-like commercial businesses. Labor trafficking is also known to have occurred in retail, mining, education, professional, and scientific specialty occupations, and the fishing industry. Cases involving various types of forced labor and sexual exploitation have also been documented among fraudulent religious organizations, which have been reported to employ manipulation and coercion. Additionally, certain instances of sanctioned prison labor may meet the definition of forced labor and human trafficking, depending on the circumstances. While hotline data on these industries is lacking, it is possible that such data could emerge in the future with increased awareness and outreach. Polaris’s research team welcomes insight from the community on additional types of trafficking that should be highlighted or explored.",Null,Null,Null,Null,,1671,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null,Null
